# JumpApp
Combined project between:  
Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies & Computer Music - Representations and Models

## Why?
This project is based on the idea of wanting to create a fun, educational and musical game, that was available online, for free, without the need to install it on your device.  
There are several applications related to ear training, but few (or none) related to the training of the singing and therefore the relative pitch.  
JumpApp manages to do this but in the form of a game!  
You can also play with a musical instrument so as to train a "sight-reading" that frees you from the musical notation.

## Game instructions
#### Settings
Two modalities of game are available: static and progressive.  
The first one allows you to train on a specific scale that you can choose between the seven modes of the major scale.  
The second one (for the more experienced) provides a progressive increase in difficulty of the game: at each level changes the modal scale of reference.  
Before starting to play, the user can decide the octave range between note C2 to B5 on which he will play.

#### Play
The game consists in jumping on each platform to avoid dropping the note.  
The platforms are arranged on eight levels corresponding to the octave of a musical scale: from the most grave to the most acute, from the bottom to the top.  
The game background has vertical lines that emphasize the beats of a time in 4/4.  
To jump the note just before it falls (so in time with the grid) you must sing the note corresponding to the next platform. In the game there can also be musical pauses identifiable by the lack of platforms, in this case you have to be silent and wait for the note to fly to the next platform to sing.
